"Mike Jones, please come to the stands". Mike heard the judge speaking this twice before finally getting up. The cop standing near the stands came to escort him. On reaching the stands,
the jude told him that his bail was granted. A person from your family is coming tomorrow to pay the bail so you can go home tomorrow. Mike was happy to hear this, he was partying on the 
inside while trying to hide his smile on the outside.

Mike was sent to prison because of drugs. He was a alleged drug dealer for the underground of Boston. When caught dealing, he refused to say the details of his supplier, saying that if he
says it then he'll be killed as he has many connections in the police.
